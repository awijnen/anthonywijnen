  		I'm an <a href="http://set.kuleuven.be/nanotechnologie/eng">Electrical Engineer</a> by education. I moved to San Francisco after graduating, where I worked at <a href="http://www.ozmodevices.com">Ozmo Devices</a> (acquired by Atmel) and <a href="http://www.sandboxindustries.com">Sandbox Industries</a>. I fell in love with software, educated my self at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>, and moved back to Belgium.

  		I'm currently working on <a href="http://www.locotalk.com">LocoTalk</a>. We've built a web application framework that will deliver the promise of the semantic web to every individual and business alike. Soon every organization will run their operations online and interact with their customers through a set of integrated LocoTalk web applications. This one is going to put a dent in the universe.
