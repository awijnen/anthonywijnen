  		Hi there, I'm Anthony, from Antwerp (Belgium). I'm currently working on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.locotalk.com">LocoTalk</a>, together with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.locotalk.com/about/team">team</a> of brilliant engineers. We've built a JavaScript Application Platform that will deliver the promise of the semantic web to every individual and business alike. Soon every organization will run their operations online and interact with their customers through a set of integrated LocoTalk web applications. This one is going to put a dent in the universe.

  		The road that led me here started in Silicon Valley. After completing my graduate degree in Electrical Engineering, I joined Ozmo Devices in Palo Alto (USA). After we got acquired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atmel.com/about/news/release.aspx?reference=tcm:26-45404">Atmel</a> I moved to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandboxindustries.com">Sandbox Industries</a> where I fell in love with software. Silicon Valley changed my life, as I've written about <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@anthonywijnen/moving-to-silicon-valley-to-upgrade-my-personal-software-be86c2b0f68e">here</a>. More than anything it triggered my brain to dream big. I decided to take some time to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flatironschool.com">learn how to code</a>, after which I moved back to Belgium to join <a target="_blank" href="http://www.locotalk.com">LocoTalk</a>.

  		That said, nothing gets me more excited than smart people with bold ideas. If that's you and you want to chat, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:aw@locotalk.com">drop me a line</a>.
