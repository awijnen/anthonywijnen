  		I'm currently working on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.locotalk.com">LocoTalk</a>. We've built a JavaScript Application Platform that will deliver the promise of the semantic web to every individual and business alike. Soon every organization will run their operations online and interact with their customers through a set of integrated LocoTalk web applications. This one is going to put a dent in the universe.
